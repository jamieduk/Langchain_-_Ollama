This page goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Ollama models.

Installation
# install package
pip install -U langchain-ollama
pip install colorama

or

pip install -r requirements.txt


if you need ollama then follow these instructions to set up and run a local Ollama instance:

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh


Download and install Ollama onto the available supported platforms (including Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Fetch available LLM model via ollama pull <name-of-model>
View a list of available models via the model library
e.g., ollama pull llama3
This will download the default tagged version of the model. Typically, the default points to the latest, smallest sized-parameter model.
On Mac, the models will be download to ~/.ollama/models

On Linux (or WSL), the models will be stored at /usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models

Specify the exact version of the model of interest as such ollama pull vicuna:13b-v1.5-16k-q4_0 (View the various tags for the Vicuna model in this instance)
To view all pulled models, use ollama list
To chat directly with a model from the command line, use ollama run <name-of-model>
View the Ollama documentation for more commands. Run ollama help in the terminal to see available commands too.
Usage
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

model = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.1")

chain = prompt | model

chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})

"Sounds like a plan!\n\nTo answer what LangChain is, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Context**\nLangChain seems to be related to language or programming, possibly in an AI context. This makes me wonder if it's a framework, library, or tool for building models or interacting with them.\n\n**Step 2: Research Possible Definitions**\nAfter some quick searching, I found that LangChain is actually a Python library for building and composing conversational AI models. It seems to provide a way to create modular and reusable components for chatbots, voice assistants, and other conversational interfaces.\n\n**Step 3: Explore Key Features and Use Cases**\nLangChain likely offers features such as:\n\n* Easy composition of conversational flows\n* Support for various input/output formats (e.g., text, audio)\n* Integration with popular AI frameworks and libraries\n\nUse cases might include building chatbots for customer service, creating voice assistants for smart homes, or developing interactive stories.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Definition**\nAfter this step-by-step analysis, I'm fairly confident that LangChain is a Python library for building conversational AI models. If you'd like to verify or provide more context, feel free to do so!"

Ask a question (or type 'exit' to quit): What is LangChain?
Response retrieved from cache! Time taken: 0.000002 seconds
LangChain is a machine learning algorithm that was developed to perform contextual word association between two or more languages using natural language processing techniques and statistical data analysis. In other words, it can identify the most common words in one language that are commonly used in another language, which in turn can be utilized for translation or communication purposes between them.
Ask a question (or type 'exit' to quit): What is time travel    
LLM response time: 45.639488 seconds
Time travel refers to the ability for humans to go back in time or to change the course of their history, altering the timeline or past events. This could be done through a variety of means, such as using time machines or teleportation technologies, but ultimately, it requires a significant amount of knowledge and skill to achieve.

In terms of understanding what's involved in time travel, let's start by examining the basic principles that underlie the concept:

1. Awareness of Time
- To use a time machine or teleportation device, one would need to be aware of their location and time period in which they are located. They must know when they are transported to the future or past.

2. Memory
- By using time travel, one can manipulate the timeline by changing historical events or altering people's memories. This requires that they understand what happened beforehand, so they can manipulate it accordingly.

3. Understanding History
- To successfully use time travel, one must have a thorough understanding of the history and society that they want to change. They must understand how the changes they want to make will impact the world around them.

4. Knowledge of Technology
- Time travel requires advanced technology, such as advanced computers or specialized teleportation devices. These require specialized knowledge and skills.

5. Expertise in Human Psychology
- Time travel requires knowledge about human psychology and emotions. By manipulating human feelings and perceptions, one can influence how people react to their surroundings and make changes accordingly.

In summary, it takes a lot of knowledge, experience, and expertise to use time travel as an effective tool for altering history or changing the course of events. It requires a deep understanding of human psychology, the ability to manipulate memories, the power of advanced technology, and a strong sense of purpose and motivation to accomplish one's goals.

Multi-modal
Ollama has support for multi-modal LLMs, such as bakllava and llava.

ollama pull bakllava

Be sure to update Ollama so that you have the most recent version to support multi-modal.
