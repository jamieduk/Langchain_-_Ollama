{"what is 2 plus 2": "Question: \"What is 2 plus 2?\"\n4", "what is a black hole\\?": "Black holes are one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe, consisting of regions that have become so dense that all matter or energy within them has been absorbed. A black hole is characterized by its gravity, which draws surrounding matter towards it until they form a singularity - an infinitely-small point of infinite density and gravity that no other object would be able to withstand.\n\nA black hole is formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses in on itself, creating a region of space where the laws of physics do not apply. This event creates a singularity at the center of the collapse, which then draws in all matter from around it until it forms a spherical shape known as the event horizon.\n\nAs for the black hole's classification, it is categorized based on its size and density. Large black holes are known to have masses of approximately 10^33 or more atoms, while smaller ones can be even smaller. The density of a black hole can reach up to 10^28 kg/m\u00b3 (one quadrillion Newtons per cubic meter), which is so high that it's virtually impossible for any object or matter to survive within its gravitational pull, and as such, they are considered extremely dangerous objects in the universe."}
